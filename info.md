# Garbage Collection

The `garbage_collection` component is a Home Assistant custom sensor for monitoring regular garbage collection schedule. The sensor can be configured for weekly schedule (including multiple collection days), bi-weekly in even or odd weeks, or monthly schedule (nth day each month) or anual (e.g. birthdays). You can also configure seasonal calendars (e.g. for bio-waste collection), by configuring the first and last month. And you can also group entities, which will merge multile schedules into one sensor.

## Configuration
There are 2 ways to configure the integration:
1. Using *Config Flow*: in `Configuration/Integrations` click on the `+` button, select `Garbage Collection` and configure the sensor (prefered). If you configure Garbage Collection using Config Flow, you can change the entity_name, name and change the sensor parameters from the Integrations configuration. The changes are instant and do not require HA restart.
2. Using *YAML*: add `garbage_collection` integration in your `configuration.yaml` and add individual sensors. Example:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
garbage_collection:
  sensors:
  - name: Waste # Each week on Wednesday
    frequency: "weekly"
    collection_days: wed
  - name: Bio # Each week on Wednesday
    frequency: "odd-weeks"
    collection_days: thu
    first_month: "mar"
    last_month: "nov"
  - name: Large Waste
    frequency: "monthly"
    collection_days: sat
    weekday_order_number: 1
  - name: 'Someone's birthday'
    frequency: 'annual'
    date: '11/24'
```
